During my investigation into the major losses recorded at the roulette tables on 3/10, 3/12, and 3/15, I found a correlation between the dealer working and the winning player. Billy Jones
was the dealer during each of the scheduled losses. Mylie Schimdt was the player that was also at the roulette tables during the exact same times. Both dealer and player accounted for each
of the 13th major losses.
I believe from the information I was able to find was that Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt are working together.
